# Summary
1. Behavior parameterization is the ability for a method to take multiple different behaviors as parameters and use them internally to accomplish different behaviors.
2. Behavior parameterization lets you make your code more adaptive to changing requirements and saves on engineering efforts in the future.
3. Passing code is a way to give new behaviors as arguments to a method. But itâ€™s verbose prior to Java 8. Anonymous classes helped a bit before Java 8 to get rid of the verbosity associated with declaring multiple concrete classes for an interface that are needed only once.
4. The Java API contains many methods that can be parameterized with different behaviors, which include sorting, threads, and GUI handling.
